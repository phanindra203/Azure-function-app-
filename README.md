Just revisiting and reinforcing my understanding of serverless functions and Blob Storage integration on Azure.
Project: Serverless Python Function App with Blob Storage on Azure
Designed and deployed a serverless Python-based application using Azure Functions, integrated with Azure Blob Storage to manage file-based events and operations in a scalable, event-driven architecture.
 Key Highlights:
Created Python-based Azure Functions to respond to HTTP and potentially Blob-triggered events.
Connected with Azure Blob Storage for file read/write operations and event handling.
Enabled CI/CD using GitHub and Azure’s Deployment Center for seamless updates.
Utilized Azure Portal and App Service Editor to manage configurations and debug in real time.
Cleaned up redundant resources to maintain cost-effective cloud infrastructure.
Tech Stack:
Azure Functions · Python · Azure Blob Storage · GitHub Actions · Azure Deployment Center · Visual Studio Code · Azure App Services
Outcome: Built a reliable, Serverless Microservice pipeline with Blob Storage integration, showcasing core skills in event-driven architecture and cloud-native development.
